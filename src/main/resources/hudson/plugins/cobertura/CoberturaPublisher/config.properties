xml.report.pattern.description=\
 This is a file name pattern that can be used to locate the cobertura xml report files \
 (for example with Maven2 use <b>**/target/site/cobertura/coverage.xml</b>). \
 The path is relative to the module root unless you have configured \
 your SCM with multiple modules, in which case it is relative to the \
 workspace root.  Note that the module root is SCM-specific, and may \
