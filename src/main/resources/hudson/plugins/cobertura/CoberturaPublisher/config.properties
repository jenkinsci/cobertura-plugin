xml.report.pattern.description=\
 This is a file name pattern that can be used to locate the cobertura xml report files \
 (for example with Maven2 use <b>**/target/site/cobertura/coverage.xml</b>). \
 The path is relative to the module root unless you have configured \
 your SCM with multiple modules, in which case it is relative to the \
 workspace root.  Note that the module root is SCM-specific, and may \
 not be the same as the workspace root. \
 <br/> \
 Cobertura must be configured to generate XML reports for this plugin to function.
only.stable.builds.description=Include only stable builds, i.e. exclude unstable and failed ones.

 For the <img src="{0}/images/16x16/health-80plus.gif" alt="100%" /> \

 For the <img src="{0}/images/16x16/health-00to19.gif" alt="0%" /> and \
 <img src="{0}/images/16x16/yellow.gif" alt="0%" /> rows, leave blank to \
 use the default values (i.e. 0).
